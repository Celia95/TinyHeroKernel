# TinyHeroKernel
An astounding Telegram bot kernel

# Introduction
This repo contains the basic code of a more advance (still private) project called SnowProject 
focused on the development of a Telegram assistant. This kernel is built on top of [pengrad's library](https://github.com/pengrad/java-telegram-bot-api).

# Installation

- Rename `src/main/java/com/raincoatmoon/EnvVariablesExample.java` as `src/main/java/com/raincoatmoon/EnvVariables.java` and fill it in with your bot credentials.

Attention: for running the programm you must properly link and set up a DB (or comment the corresponding lines in `src/main/java/com/raincoatmoon/main.java`).
